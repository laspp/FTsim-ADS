    "TaskDescription": "You've learned many things in this tutorial. The final task is to move belt a little forward when first workpiece is detected by <b>PhotocellExit</b>, so there is space for another one. \nBe creative at coding and note, that you should <b>addres IO tag just once in your code.</b> If it is adressed multiple times, the last one overrides the previous one. A fast solution looks like this:\nIO.<tagName> := <bool varibale1> OR <bool varibale1>\nStart the test when both workpieces reach destination.",
