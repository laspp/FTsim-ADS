It needs to be covered to pass the test. Furthermore we need to program <b>MotorCompressor</b> to run when <b>SwitchCompressor</b> is active. Compressor is used to increase preasure in air tank and consiquently move pistons when their valves are opened. To complete the test, run MotorCompressor for 3 seconds to build up the preasure",
