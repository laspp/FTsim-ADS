It's tag is <b>PhotocellEntry</b>. The ray must be interrupted to pass the test. Furthermore we need to program <b>MotorCompressor</b> to run when <b>SwitchCompressor</b> is active. Compressor is used to increase preasure in air tank and move pistons when corresponding valves are opened. To complete the test, MotorCompressor should run for 3 seconds to build up the preasure",
