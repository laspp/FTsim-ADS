    "TaskDescription": "Before we start programing the process line, we need to understand the bacis. We will work mostly whit boolean values.The change of state is called edge.\nFALSE -> TRUE is rising edge\nTRUE -> FALSE is falling edge.\nIn this tutorial we will use edge detection of lower middle button (tag <b>IO.ButtonBlackLeftDown</b>, key <b>S</b>) to detect the edges.\nBut how do we programaticly detect pulse change? Your PLC somulator constantly loops the code written in MAIN. Declare boolean variable <b>buttonOldValue</b> and at the end of current code assign value of ButtonBlackLeftDown to it.\nNow write and if statement that will check if buttonOldValue is different from current ButtonBlackLeftDown value. If it is, then we have detected the edge. Which one?\nOn rising edge, start <b>Timer Pulse</b> or shorter <b>TP</b> timer and set in on 2 seconds. Link timers output to lower blue light (tag <b>LEDBlueDown</b>) and the light will turn on for 2 seconds after button was pressed\nStart testing as soon as you press down the button.",
