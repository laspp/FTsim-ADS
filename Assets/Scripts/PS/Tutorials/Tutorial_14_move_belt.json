    "TaskDescription": "Timers are not the best approach here since we don't know how long it takes for  different items to travel with the belt, because we don't know their weight. Reuse the falling edge detection of ExitPiston and set newly declared boolean variable (e.g. runBelt) to true. Link it to <b>MotorBeltMovement</b> tag and set it to false when <b>PhotocellExit</b> detects workpiece.\nStart testing when belt starts moving.",
