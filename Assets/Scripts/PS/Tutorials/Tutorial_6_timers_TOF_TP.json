    "TaskDescription": "You've learnet about TP timer. It starts counting as soon as input is true and turns off after specified time, regardless of the input. The <b>Timer oFF Delay</b> or shorter <b>TOF</b> and <b>Timer On Delay</b> or shorter <b>TON</b> both take input into account.\n<b>TON</b> timer starts counting as soon as input is true, and when specified time is passed becomes true. It's used to filter out short signals.\n<b>TOF</b> timer is true as soon as input is positive. On inputs falling edge starts counting and turns off output signal after set time. It's used to extend the signal duration.\nLink TOF timer to upper blue light (tag <b>LEDBlueUp</b>). The light should turn on when the <b>ButtonBlackLeftDown</b> is pressed and turn off 3 seconds after the buttons falling edge.\nComment the code from previous exercise and set <b>LEDBlueDown</b> to TON timer's output. Set it's time to 2 seconds.\nStart testing as soon as you press the button and hold it for 4 seconds, not more",
